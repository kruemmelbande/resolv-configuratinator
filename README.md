# resolv-configuratinator
tired of tools not configuring your /etc/resolv.conf enough? Well this tool will probably make it worse

This tool will be the one tool to keep your /etc/resolv.conf consistent once and for all.

Tailscale overwriting your /etc/resolv.conf even though you disabled it like 6 times?  
Network manager not knowing its place?  
Resolvconf deciding that you dont need a dns?  

With resolv-configuratinator you can force a resolv.conf no matter what.  
If any tool decides to change the config, resolv-configuratinator will simply overwrite it with your /etc/resolv.configuratinator file

Make sure your /etc/resolv.configuratinator file starts with '# generated by configuratinator'
